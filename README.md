# Yundera CasaOS 3rd-Party AppStore

## About
This AppStore provides a curated list of applications compatible with CasaOS running on Yundera servers. The apps are specifically configured to work with the nsl.sh mesh router service and are accessible over HTTPS by default.

### Key Differences from Official CasaOS AppStore
Regular CasaOS app URL:
```http://demo.casaos.io:5230/```

Yundera app URL:
```https://memo-demo.nsl.sh```

All apps are designed to run on CasaIMG, a dockerized version of CasaOS.
All apps are accessible over HTTPS by default.
All apps are tested on Yundera servers using a nsl.sh routing domain.
